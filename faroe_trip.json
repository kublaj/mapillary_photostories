  "intro": "My son Oskar wanted a road trip for our holiday week this year. We were thinking to go to Norway, Jotunheimen, when we read about the Faroe Island petition and the Sheep View project. How cool! I booked the tickets the day after we read the article, and last week we set off to drive as many of the roads of the Faroe Islands as possible.",
